## Description

This brief was assigned to me as Project Exam 2 during my Front-End studies.

The goal of the assignment was:
"_To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills._"

The brief was described as: "_A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application._

_There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues._".

<br />

The project consists of 6 pages:

- A home page where users can view / filter venues
- A individual venue page showing the details of the selected venue
  - Allows for customers to book the venue
  - Allows for venue managers to update / delete a venue they manage
- Profile page
  - Allows for the user to update their avatar
- Create page
  - Allows venue managers to create venues
- A login page
- A register page

<br />

The following user stories were required by the brief:

- [x] A user may view a list of Venues
- [x] A user may search for a specific Venue
- [x] A user may view a specific Venue page by id
- [x] A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
- [x] A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a customer
- [x] A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
- [x] A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
- [x] A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager
- [x] A registered Venue manager may create a Venue
- [x] A registered Venue manager may update a Venue they manage
- [x] A registered Venue manager may delete a Venue they manage
- [x] A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
- [x] A registered user may login
- [x] A registered user may update their avatar
- [x] A registered user may logout

<br />

Additionally I implemented:

- Ability to cancel bookings
- A functional media gallery on the venue page
- Filter functionality on the home page
